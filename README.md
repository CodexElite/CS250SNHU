# Essential Questions – Computer Science Program

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
Interpreting user needs begins with active listening, gathering requirements, and asking clarifying questions to understand what the user is really trying to accomplish. User stories help because they break down needs into simple, actionable statements from the perspective of the user. This ensures development stays focused on delivering value and keeps the program aligned with real-world use cases.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
I approach developing programs by breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable tasks, iterating frequently, and testing along the way. Agile processes such as **daily stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and continuous integration** are valuable because they encourage collaboration, transparency, and adaptability. In the future, I plan to use Agile principles to ensure my work remains flexible, responsive to change, and centered around delivering working solutions.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, sharing knowledge, and supporting others while being accountable for your own work. It involves respecting diverse perspectives, staying open to feedback, and focusing on the team’s shared goals rather than just individual contributions. A good team member is adaptable, dependable, and actively works to build trust and collaboration within the group.
